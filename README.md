#Outline for Reposotory

##1. CSV Files
### The five CSV files in the resposotory helped set up our intitial Data Frame that we pulling our data From. 'Athlete_events' was our main data source that we found on Kaggle that include our olympic history data ranging from 1896 to 2016. The other four ('country_codes', 'country_lat_long', 'noc_regions, and 'population_by_country') were all additions we made to our main dataframe to help broaden the reach of our data anlaysis.

##2. Jupyter Notebook Files
### Ended up using multiple jupyter notebooks becasuse we each used the data frame that had been cleaned up and took it in multiple directions for analysis.
### 1. BaseData: This is the code for initial data exploration and clean up. Used to merge our CSV files together into one dataframe.
### 2. BaseData-Bob Copy. This is code for exploration, chart production, and analysis for comparing countries that just competed in summer against countries that participated in both seasons of olympics.
### 3. BaseData-PR: This is code for exploration and chart production looking at the differences in number of events and number of athletes sent by each country. While part of our exploration process, did not end up presenting.
### 4. Summer_Winter Gold Medal Winners: This is code for creating our gold% variable by finding # of golds won by each country and finding the number of golds given out each year. Gold% was averaged across time for all countries and findings were put into 2 scatter plots, one for each season.
### 5. Latitude Performance - EK: This is code for the analysis of total medals won by each country, and to create scatter plots of medals vs latitude for both the winter and summer olympics.

##3. Output File
### This file includes all of the outputs that we presented as well as the outputs that we created during our exploration phase. Ended up not being able to present all of the different original questions that we came up with as we explored the data.
